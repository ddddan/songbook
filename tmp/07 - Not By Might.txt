7.	Not by Might
Verse 1
"Not by might, nor by power,
But by My Spirit", says the Lord
Mountains fall this very hour
And we shall overcome

Chorus
Emanuel!  We call Your Name!
"God with us", we still proclaim
Mountains fall this very hour
And we shall overcome
 
Verse 2
Salvation's here, His Kingdom's come
The devil cast down from the throne
By Jesus' blood, and by His Word,
We shall overcome

Verse 3
So do not fear the raging storm
Or any weapon that's been formed
The heavens resound, the victory's won
For we have overcome
