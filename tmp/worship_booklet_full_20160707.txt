Verse 1
Your strength is finished, the well has run dry
What is the point of your striving?
You gave your all, but as hard as you try,
The answer's still not arriving.

Chorus
God is able, God is able
To do immeasurably more than
We can ask or imagine
God is able, God is able
He'll do what he said he will do

Verse 2
He brought two fishes, 
 and five loaves of bread
When no one else had brought any
But Jesus took it, and lifted his head
And broke it out for so many

His grace is all we need
His power is made perfect in our weakness

According to his power that is
 working within us
To him be glory in the church
And to Christ Jesus throughout all generations
Forever and ever amen!
 
2.	With All Your Heart
Verse 1
As you enter into a new season of life
Not knowing what the future may hold
And you wonder how you will make it
And how your story will unfold

Maybe life hasn't been so kind to you
Maybe plans that you had seem undone
And you wonder is it still worth dreaming
Has the Lord or the enemy won?

Chorus 
For I know the plans I have for you
Plans to prosper, not to harm you
I will give you a hope and a future
This is what the Lord declares

You will call on me and pray to me
You will seek and you will find me
I will listen to you and be found by you
When you seek me -- with all your heart.

Verse 2
So you come to the crossroads, 
  the fork in the road
And you wonder which way you should go
Can you look to the Master, 
  and trust in his Name
Can you hold to the promises you know?

Bridge
Something dies, something rises
From the ashes, new horizons
Something new is arriving
You're not dead -- God's reviving!
 
3.	Restore Us, O God

Needing the cross today

Restore us, O Lord God Almighty
Make your face shine upon us
That we may be saved (x2)

Hoping you’ll see us through
Please don’t delay
Help us today, Lord we pray

Bridge
