<h2>1.	God Is Able</h2>
<h3>Verse 1</h3>
Your strength is finished, the well has run dry<br>
What is the point of your striving?<br>
You gave your all, but as hard as you try,<br>
The answer's still not arriving.<br>

<h3>Chorus</h3>
God is able, God is able<br>
To do immeasurably more than<br>
We can ask or imagine<br>
God is able, God is able<br>
He'll do what he said he will do<br>

<h3>Verse 2</h3>
He brought two fishes, <br>
 and five loaves of bread<br>
When no one else had brought any<br>
But Jesus took it, and lifted his head<br>
And broke it out for so many<br>

His grace is all we need<br>
His power is made perfect in our weakness<br>

<h3>Bridge</h3>
According to his power that is<br>
 working within us<br>
To him be glory in the church<br>
And to Christ Jesus throughout all generations<br>
Forever and ever amen!<br>

<div class="colbreak"></div>
<h2>2.	With All Your Heart</h2>
<h3>Verse 1</h3>
As you enter into a new season of life<br>
Not knowing what the future may hold<br>
And you wonder how you will make it<br>
And how your story will unfold<br>

Maybe life hasn't been so kind to you<br>
Maybe plans that you had seem undone<br>
And you wonder is it still worth dreaming<br>
Has the Lord or the enemy won?<br>

<h3>Chorus </h3>
For I know the plans I have for you<br>
Plans to prosper, not to harm you<br>
I will give you a hope and a future<br>
This is what the Lord declares<br>

You will call on me and pray to me<br>
You will seek and you will find me<br>
I will listen to you and be found by you<br>
When you seek me -- with all your heart.<br>

<h3>Verse 2</h3>
So you come to the crossroads, <br>
  the fork in the road<br>
And you wonder which way you should go<br>
Can you look to the Master, <br>
  and trust in his Name<br>
Can you hold to the promises you know?<br>

<h3>Bridge</h3>
Something dies, something rises<br>
From the ashes, new horizons<br>
Something new is arriving<br>
You're not dead -- God's reviving!<br>

<h2>3.	Restore Us, O God</h2>
<h3>Verse 1</h3>
Sometimes in life we fight,<br>
Trying to do what’s right<br>
Thinking we know the way<br>

But we are going astray<br>
Sometimes we feel deprived,<br>
Wanting to soar and thrive<br>
But we are lost<br>
Needing the cross today<br>

<h3>Chorus</h3>
Restore us, O Lord God Almighty<br>
Make your face shine upon us<br>
That we may be saved (x2)<br>

Restore us, O Lord God Almighty<br>
Make your face shine upon us<br>
That we may be saved,<br>
That we may be saved, O Lord<br>

<h3>Verse 2</h3>
All of life’s plans and dreams<br>
Fading away like steam<br>
Everything seems so bleak<br>
All of the wrong things we seek<br>

All we have left is you<br>
Hoping you’ll see us through<br>
Please don’t delay<br>
Help us today, Lord we pray<br>

<h3>Bridge</h3>
You are the God of Jacob<br>
You are the Lord of all<br>
You are the strong deliverer<br>
You are the Great I Am<br>

You know the end from the beginning<br>
You see the glory to come<br>
And we can trust your love for us<br>
Forever more!<br>

<h2>4.	A New Thing</h2>
<h3>Chorus</h3>
God is doing a new thing<br>
It's a renewing<br>
Making my heart sing <br>
Every day<br>

He's taken the old thing<br>
Now we're beholding<br>
New things unfolding<br>
Coming our way!<br>

<h3>Verse 1</h3>
Yesterday's gone<br>
Tomorrow is another day<br>
Time marches on<br>
We can't live in yesterday<br>

Embrace the new<br>
The blessings that He has for you<br>
Don't be afraid<br>
He's promised He'll see you through!<br>

<h3>Verse 2</h3>
Refined in the fire<br>
The worthless things are stripped away<br>
Spirit inspired<br>
We gotta let Him have His way<br>

Never look back<br>
Don't dwell upon your past mistakes<br>
Stay on the track<br>
And live your life for Jesus's sake!<br>
